ACADEMIC PROJECTS
=================

- Subdivision Surface Modeling of Polygonal Meshes                                               Jan 2013 - May 2013
  Adviser: Dr. L. Gudino
  * Study of data structures used to describe polygon meshes, polygon subdivision conversion algorithms, and theoretical concepts of surface continuity
  * Developed an application in C using the OpenGL API and implemented the Catmull-Clark and Doo-Sabin subdivision conversion algorithms
    
- Analysis of finite sets sampled from Euclidean space quasi-ordered by comparison relations     Jan 2014 - May 2014
  Adviser: Dr. Ramprasad Joshi
  * The project started with strong constraints on the graph and relaxing them to generalize the result
  * Study of embedding weighted graphs from Rn space to R3 space to help solve and visualize n-ary equations with n-variables
    
- HTTP Client using Socket Programming                                                           Jan 2014 - May 2014
  Academic Project for the course Computer Networks
  Developed an HTTP Client using Socket Programming in C. This client was designed to GET an HTML page pointed to by the given HTTP URL and all its associated images. In addition, the application, decoded images encoded using the base64 encoding technique and generated the equivalent PNG images    
    
- Raytracer                                                                                      August 2013
  Raytracer is a light simulation program used in computer graphics to achieve a photo-realistic output. Implemented a Raytracer for lambert materials in C++ using OpenGL 2.0 API representing the polygonal mesh using a winged-edge data structure
