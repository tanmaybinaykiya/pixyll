### Work Experience

- May 2016 - July 2017: Senior Software Engineer, BlueJeans Networks  
  * Reengineered the application design to enable a pure micro-service architecture
  * Refactored the existing backend codebase to facilitate deployments as microservices to enable hitless releases
  * Designed, developed and deployed a solution to enable live streaming BlueJeans video conferences into Facebook Live video

- July 2015 – May 2016: Software Engineer, BlueJeans Networks   
  * Worked on improving the resiliency of the product against failure of infrastructure components like database, cache, zookeeper, message brokers. This was achieved by a variety of methods, viz. leveraging other infrastructure components as fallback or reducing dependency on the component. It also involved ch    anging service interactions with third party integrations  
  * Designed the algorithm and developed a system to auto-scale Wowza Streaming Engine based media transcoders using real-time usage patterns  

- July 2014 – July 2015: Software Intern, BlueJeans Networks   
  * Developed tools for Web UI Automation to enable multi-browser, multi-node concurrent testing  
  * Designed and developed a tool to simulate high server loads for benchmarking and stress testing

### Academic Projects

- Subdivision Surface Modeling of Polygonal Meshes  
  Jan 2013 - May 2013  
  Adviser: [Dr. L. Gudino](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/lucy/profile)  
  [Project source available here](https://github.com/tanmaybinaykiya/COP) 
  * Study of data structures used to describe polygon meshes, polygon subdivision conversion algorithms, and theoretical concepts of surface continuity  
  * Developed an application in C using the OpenGL API and implemented the Catmull-Clark and Doo-Sabin subdivision conversion algorithms  

- Analysis of finite sets sampled from Euclidean space quasi-ordered by comparison relations  
  Jan 2014 - May 2014  
  Adviser: [Dr. Ramprasad Joshi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=2Sv-n_sAAAAJ)  
  * The project started with strong constraints on the graph and relaxing them to generalize the result  
  * Study of embedding weighted graphs from Rn space to R3 space to help solve and visualize n-ary equations with n-variables  
    
- HTTP Client using Socket Programming  
  Jan 2014 - May 2014  
  [Project source available here](https://github.com/tanmaybinaykiya/codebin/tree/master/CN/httpClient)  
  Developed an HTTP Client using Socket Programming in C. This client was designed to GET an HTML page pointed to by the given HTTP URL and all its associated images. Additionally, the application, decoded images encoded using the base64 encoding technique and generated the equivalent PNG images 

- Raytracer  
  August 2013   
  [Project source available here](https://github.com/tanmaybinaykiya/Raytracer)  
  Raytracer is a light simulation program used in computer graphics to achieve a photo-realistic output. Implemented a Raytracer for lambert materials in C++ using OpenGL 2.0 API representing the polygonal mesh using a winged-edge data structure
